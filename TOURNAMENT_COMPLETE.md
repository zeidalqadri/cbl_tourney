### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Loaded all 107 teams**
   - 62 boys teams (Groups LA-LN)
   - 45 girls teams (Groups PA-PH + extras)

2. **Implemented consistent team naming**

## What's Next?

The tournament system is now ready for use! The UI will automatically display the new team names with (B)/(G) suffixes.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Create schools table**: The SQL migration (`create-schools-table.sql`) is ready if you want to add a proper parent-child relationship in the database.

2. **Add display_name column**: Run this SQL in Supabase dashboard:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tournament_teams 
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS display_name TEXT;
   ```

3. **Update bracket logic**: The tournament progression logic should already work with the current structure.

## Verification

Run `node verify-tournament-setup.mjs` at any time to verify:
- All 107 teams are loaded
- All 129 matches are present
- Proper (B)/(G) naming is maintained
- No duplicate matches exist
