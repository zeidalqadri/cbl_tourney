# Boys Tournament Progression Logic Fix

## Summary
Successfully implemented proper boys division tournament progression logic that uses second round standings instead of single-elimination quarter-finals.

## Problem
- Boys semi-finals were showing incorrect teams (MALIM vs BKT BERUANG, BACHANG vs ALOR GAJAH)
- Should have been: CHENG vs CHABAU, YU HWA vs BKT BERUANG
- User requested: "can we ensure that this be done through fixing the logic and no placeholders?"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Standings Calculation Logic
- `scripts/recalculate-boys-semis.js` - Calculates second round standings and updates semi-finals
- Analyzes all 18 boys second round matches
- Calculates wins, losses, points for/against for each team
- Sorts by wins, then point differential
- Updates semi-finals with correct teams

### 2. Updated Core Tournament Progression
- Modified `src/lib/tournament-progression.ts` to include:
  - `calculateBoysSecondRoundStandings()` - Calculates standings from matches
  - `progressBoysToSemiFinals()` - Progresses top 4 teams to semi-finals
  - Updated `progressToKnockoutStage()` to handle boys division differently

### 3. Verification Scripts
- `scripts/test-boys-progression.js` - Tests current semi-final teams
- `scripts/verify-tournament-integrity.js` - Comprehensive integrity check
- `scripts/check-cheng-record.js` - Investigates specific team records

## Current State

### Boys Semi-Finals (Correct)
- **Match #125**: CHENG (B) vs CHABAU (B)
- **Match #127**: YU HWA (B) vs BKT BERUANG (B)

### Top 4 Teams by Standings
1. YU HWA (B): 3W-0L
2. CHABAU (B): 3W-0L  
3. BKT BERUANG (B): 2W-0L
4. CHENG (B): 2W-0L

### Girls Semi-Finals (Unchanged)
- **Match #124**: KEH SENG (G) vs CHABAU (G)
- **Match #126**: KIOW MIN (G) vs CHIAO CHEE (G)

## Key Features
- Logic-based progression, no manual placeholders
- Automatic calculation from match results
- Supports different tournament formats per division:
  - Boys: Multi-match second round → Top 4 to semi-finals
  - Girls: Traditional single-elimination quarter-finals
- Includes progression metadata showing how teams advanced

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/tournament-progression.ts` - Core progression logic
2. Created multiple verification and fix scripts in `scripts/`

## Testing
All tests passing:
- ✅ Boys semi-finals have correct teams
- ✅ Progression logic working correctly
- ✅ Database integrity maintained
- ✅ UI displays correct teams

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Could implement automatic progression triggers when matches complete
- Could add UI to show second round standings table
- Could add visual indicators for progression method (standings vs direct advancement)
