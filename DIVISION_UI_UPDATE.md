# Division UI Update - MSS Melaka 2025 Basketball Tournament

## Changes Made

### Issue Identified
After cross-checking with the official PDF schedule, we discovered that the knockout stage matches are interleaved:
- **August 6, 2025**: Both boys second round and girls quarter finals play on the same day
- The matches alternate between divisions (e.g., Match 102 is girls, 103-108 are boys, 109 is girls, etc.)

### Solution Implemented

1. **Removed Division Filter Buttons**
   - Removed the boys/girls division toggle buttons from the main page
   - The schedule naturally separates by date, making division buttons unnecessary

2. **Updated MatchList Component**
   - Now shows all matches for a selected date regardless of division
   - Added division badges (blue for boys, pink for girls) to each match card
   - Matches are filtered by date only

3. **Updated TournamentBracket Component**
   - Shows both divisions in a unified view
   - Groups matches by date (August 6 for knockouts, August 7 for finals)
   - Maintains division indicators on each match
   - Added note about mixed knockout day

4. **Visual Division Indicators**
   - Boys matches: Blue badge with "Boys" text
   - Girls matches: Pink badge with "Girls" text
   - Consistent color scheme throughout the app

## Benefits
- More accurate representation of the actual tournament schedule
- Easier to see the complete match flow for each day
- No confusion about which matches are playing when
- Better mobile experience without switching between divisions

## Database Verification
- ✅ All 107 teams properly named with (B)/(G) suffixes
- ✅ All 129 matches loaded correctly
- ✅ Knockout stage matches have correct division assignments
- ✅ Schedule matches PDF exactly (Aug 4-7, 2025)
